      Why is Chicago the <strong><em>BEST</em></strong> Musical
    </h1>
    <h3>(In my opinion)</h3>

    <p>
      Chicago is a 1975 American musical with music by John Kander, lyrics by
      Fred Ebb, and book by Ebb and Bob Fosse. Set in Chicago in the jazz age,
      the musical is based on a 1926 play of the same title by Maurine Dallas
      Watkins about actual criminals and crimes on which she reported. (from
      Wikipedia)
