    <h1>
      Coffee Is Superior</h1>
    
    <p>
      Coffee is the best drink ever invented.<br>
      It will fuel your day with it's one of a kind taste & aroma<br>
      If your not a fan, what a shame, the best drink in town will go to waste!<br>
      The motivation to wake me from my slumber<br>
 </p>
    <h1> Why Is Coffee The Best Drink?</h1>
      <ul>
   <li> Cofee will give you energy</li>
    <li>Coffee has an amazing smell</li>
    <li> All coffee flavored things taste AMAZING</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I understand the dislike for coffee if you cannot drink coffee due to a heart condition or such. 
      Besdies that, in my mind, there are limited excuses for the disate of the amamzing beverage.<br>
Despite lies <strong><em> Coffee does NOT stunt your growth. </em></strong><br>
The only side effect is slighly tinting your teeth yellow.
